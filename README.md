GraphQL Inspector ouputs a list of changes between two GraphQL schemas. Every change is precisely explained and marked as breaking, non-breaking or dangerous.
It helps you validate documents and fragments and find similar types.

![Example](./demo.gif)

## Installation

```bash
yarn add graphql-inspector
```

## CLI Usage

```bash
graphql-inspector diff OLD_SCHEMA NEW_SCHEMA
graphql-inspector validate DOCUMENTS SCHEMA
graphql-inspector similar SCHEMA
graphql-inspector help
```

### Examples

```bash
$ graphql-inspector diff OLD_SCHEMA NEW_SCHEMA

üõë  Field `name` was removed from object type `Post`

} from 'graphql-inspector';

// diff
